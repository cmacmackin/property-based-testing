# Property Based Testing in Python
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cmacmackin/property-based-testing/HEAD?labpath=hypothesis-demo.ipynb)

This repository provides a Jupyter notebook introducing property-based
testing in Python using the
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. It
was written as a post for the internal UKAEA software development
blog. The code is provided here so people can try running and
modifying it themselves. You can do this either by cloning the
repository or running it with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) using
the following link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cmacmackin/property-based-testing/HEAD?labpath=hypothesis-demo.ipynb.
